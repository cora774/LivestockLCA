## Summary of Life Cycle Analysis

In this analysis, I examined the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities of different livestock production systems using the GLEAM dataset. Specifically, I focused on emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O, the three major GHGs contributing to climate change.

### Emission Intensity Breakdown: 
For each production system, I calculated the GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) and determined the percentage contribution of each gas to the total emissions. These percentages were applied to the aggregated emission intensity values (measured in kg CO2e per kg protein), determining the specific contribution of each GHG to the overall emissions intensity for each system.

### Key Insights

##### 1.Grassland and Mixed systems exhibit the highest total emission intensities, with methane (CH4) being the predominant contributor.

##### 2. Feedlots also displayed significant emissions, but with a more balanced contribution between CO2, CH4, and N2O.

##### 3. Chicken production systems (Broilers, Layers, and Backyard systems) showed relatively lower emission intensities, with CO2 contributing more significantly than methane and nitrous oxide.

## Sustainability Next-Steps for the LCA:

##### 1. Targeting High Emission Systems: The Grassland and Mixed systems have the highest GHG emission intensities. To improve sustainability:

Enteric Fermentation Management: Since CH4 is a major contributor, implementing strategies to reduce methane from enteric fermentation, such as dietary adjustments (e.g., feed additives like seaweed) or improving animal genetics, can significantly reduce emissions.
Pasture Management: Enhancing the quality of pastures through better land management (e.g., rotational grazing, reducing overgrazing) can improve animal productivity and reduce the emission intensity per kg of protein.

##### 2. Feedlot Optimization: Feedlots show significant emissions from a mix of Ghgs. For sustainability:

Manure Management: Improving manure handling and storage systems (e.g., anaerobic digesters to capture methane for energy) can reduce CH4 and N2O emissions.
Energy Use: Implementing renewable energy sources (solar, wind) on feedlot operations can help reduce CO2 emissions from direct and indirect energy use.
Reducing CO2 Emissions in Lower Intensity Systems: For systems like Backyard, Broilers, and Layers, where CO2 contributes most to total emissions:

##### 3. Improving Energy Efficiency: Investing in energy-efficient practices or renewable energy sources for on-farm energy use (e.g., heating, ventilation, and machinery) can reduce CO2 emissions.

Feed Efficiency: Ensuring efficient feed use can minimize the environmental footprint, reducing both CO2 from energy use and CH4 emissions linked to feed production and digestion.
Implementing Carbon Sequestration: Introducing practices that promote carbon sequestration (such as agroforestry or integrating trees into livestock systems) can offset some of the GHG emissions, especially in Grassland systems.

##### 4. Feed Production: Consider emissions from fertilizer use, land-use change, and transportation in feed supply chains.

Post-Farm Gate: Analyze emissions during processing, packaging, transportation, and retail stages to identify additional areas for emission reductions.
Developing Circular Systems: Integrating livestock systems with other agricultural practices can reduce emissions. For instance:

##### 5. Policy Advocacy and Farmer Education. 

Engaging with policymakers to support incentive programs that encourage farmers to adopt sustainable livestock management practices (e.g., subsidies for methane-reducing technologies) can drive industry-wide improvements. Additionally, investing in farmer education programs focused on sustainability can help accelerate the adoption of best practices.

### OPINION: The "Sustainable" Consumer Choice:

Due to their low emission intensity, and comparatively low aggregate emissions, the most sustainable meat choice would be chicken. A vegetarian diet isn't considered in this LCA because other agricultural production emissions were not analyzed for comparison. If one is going to eat red meat, they have to make a moral decision: consume inexpensive meat that is mass produced via unethical means in feedlots that have lower emission intensity, or consume more expensive meat that is produced more ethically in mixed and grassland systems with a much higher emission intensity. My personal moral decision would be to consume ethically sourced red meat, less frequently (Consuming once a week rather than daily).
